# Blockchain Project

This project is a Hardhat-based blockchain application that includes a Solidity smart contract, deployment scripts, and test cases.

## Project Structure

- **contracts/**: Contains the Solidity smart contract code.
- **scripts/**: Contains scripts for deploying the smart contract.
- **test/**: Contains test cases for the smart contract.
- **hardhat.config.ts**: Configuration file for Hardhat.
- **package.json**: npm configuration file.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
2. **Compile Contracts**: Use `npx hardhat compile` to compile the smart contracts.
3. **Deploy Contracts**: Run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts` to deploy the contracts to the blockchain.
4. **Run Tests**: Execute `npx hardhat test` to run the test cases for the smart contract.

## Usage Guidelines

- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
- Modify the smart contract in the `contracts/Contract.sol` file as needed.
- Update the deployment script in `scripts/deploy.ts` for different deployment scenarios.
- Add more test cases in `test/Contract.test.ts` to cover additional functionalities.
